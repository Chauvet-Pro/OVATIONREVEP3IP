## USB Software Update Instructions
1.  Power on the product and plug the flash drive into the USB port.
2.	Once the flash drive has been detected, the message “***Upgrade***” will be displayed. Press **< YES >**.
3.	The next screen will show the software versions available for this fixture on the USB drive.
4.	The upgrade will start. DO NOT turn off the power or disconnect the USB while the USB LED is still blinking during the process. 
5.  Go to **Sys Info** on the fixture's menu map and confirm the firmware revision.
6.	When the boot-up process is finished, restart the fixture. It is always recommended to do a factory reset and power cycle the units after a software update to ensure that the update is succesful and the new values load properly.


### Special Notes
* Place the .chl file in the root directory of the USB drive.
* The product's USB port supports up to 32GB capacity and only works with FAT32 file format.
* Turning off the power or removing the USB while still blinking during the update will cause partial or total firmware failure in the targeted fixture(s). If this occurs, the user will need the **UPLOAD 01** device to fix this.
